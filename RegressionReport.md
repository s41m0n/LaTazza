# Regression Report for Visual Test Cases

```
<Report here the changes that you had to perform on the Visual test cases, indicating for each one:
- if the Visual test case was still working after the modification (non-fragile test case)
- if the Visual test case was not working after the modifications in the GUI (fragile test case)
- the number of screen captures that you had to adapt to the modification, and the percentage of changed captures (computed as the ratio: changed screen captures / total screen captures, for each test case)>
```
