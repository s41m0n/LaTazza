<This document is about your observations and lessons learnt on the project. They will not be used to grade the project> 

# Requirements


<Report here your observations, if any, about the requirement document produced by the first deadline>
<Would you do it differently now?>

As it was the first delivery, we decided to spend more hours than the expected ones to produce a complete and exhaustive document. Probably, if we knew a priori the future specifications, we would have spent less time, not caring about all the details
which apparently turned out to be irrelevant.

# Design


<Report here your observations, if any, about the design  document produced by the second  deadline>
<Would you do it differently now?>

Once the official requirement document was given, it was easy to produce the design document, since in our opinion there were only few
possible decision to be taken. Realizing the document took us just 2 hours together to debate and deciding which of our proposals fit the project the best. It turned out that we all had, more or less, the same idea.


# Code and test cases

<Report here your observations, if any, about the test cases and code produced by the third and fourth deadline>

In spite coding and testing are the most time-consuming part, we enjoyed not only facing all the problems, but also working
together to produce an easy, short but efficient code, using almost always the programming language specific efficient functions.
During this phase, we understood the importance of testing our own system, trying to cover all of its component. In fact, none of us had ever
implemented so many test cases before, since we were used to perform our raw manual tests.

# Changes

<Report here your observations, if any, about the three change cycles corresponding to deadlines 5,6,7>

It was quite easy to deal with the change cycle, especially for the 5th and 6th deliveries. Our design and implementation allowed us to perform
such changes introducing few code lines for the new program logic. For the last delivery, we strongly believe that all the eyeAutomate part is terribly time-consuming
and useless, since it does not improve any of the student skills required not only in this course, but also in the others. 


# Build, tools and environment

<Report here your observations, if any, about the tools and environment used>

We appreciated how all the project library dependencies were automatically managed by Maven, it improves the project portability. Concerning GitLab and the used tools such its pipelines, we understood the importance of having an automatized project build chain, especially if working in a team.
Everything is setup correctly, except for eyeAutomate. Honestly speaking, we suggest to take away this part from the project, since it is both time-consuming and 
not useful at all for our personal development. It is impossible that the eyeAutomatic part takes more time than some other deliveries.

# Other observations

<Report here any other comment or suggestion >

Basing the course on a group project is a brilliant and stimulant idea. Although, we suggest to consider the amount of hour spent by each group in developing
this project, thinking if every task was extremely necessary. We expected to be given more information concerning deliveries, especially in the first ones: we recognize
that when we have to deal with external customer we should expect to receive a very poor problem specification, but as this is a school project and we do not
want to contact the professor for every detail, we found ourself taking decisions alone sometimes (or until other student asked for the specific problem).
