# Context Diagram and Interfaces
## Context Diagram

The context diagram can be derived.

- The principal actors in the system are the following:

	- **Manager**
	- **Employee**
	- **Visitor**

The system itself has references to the inventory for the capsules, so the latter is not needed in the representation.	

```plantuml
left to right direction
skinparam packageStyle rectangle
actor Employee as e
actor Visitor as v
actor Manager as m

rectangle System {
  (LaTazza) as lt
  e--lt: "Service usage"
  v--lt: "Service usage"
  lt--m: "Service guarantee"
}
```

## Interfaces
The following interfaces are needed for the realization of the system.

| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Manager     | Access to system | GUI/Web page |
| Employee     | Access to system | GUI/Web page |
| Visitor     | Access to system | GUI/Web page |
| Banking System     | Perform payments | Web Service using APIs |

Each actor among Manager, Employee and Visitor will exploit a different type of account, more in particular:

	1. General/Admin for Managers
	2. Local for Employees
	3. Visitor for Visitors
Of course, each account will manage the users in different ways with different permissions.
