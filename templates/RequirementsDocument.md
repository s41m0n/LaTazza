# General Assumptions

In this section we insert all the assumptions we made in order to avoid incoherences in the document.

1.  LaTazza is a desktop application with two different interfaces:
	 - interface for the manager;
	 - interface for the employees.
	Moreover, in order to buy a capsule a visitor can only refer to the manager.
2.	Both the interfaces communicate with the server:
	 - the server stores data concerning accounts, orders, available capsules and payments.
3.	When an employee downloads the application he can create his own account.
4.	It is possible to buy many capsules (100) at a time using the application (Employee).
5.	The desktop application interface for the **employee** allows to:
	 - create an account;
	 - login/logout with own account;
	 - buy capsules (max 100, even different types);
	 - add a payment method to the account;
	 - add cash to the account to buy credits;
	 - pay off debts (using an associated payment method);
	 - schedule future purchases (if there are no available capsules).
6.	The desktop application interface for the **manager** allows to:
	 - login/logout with own account;
	 - manage options and privileges (including the possibility to promote an employee as new manager);
	 - manage employees' account (delete, pay off debts using cash, assign credits, manage pending purchases);
	 - manage inventory;
	 - order capsules from vendors
	 - pay capsules order.
7.	LaTazza can sell capsules from different vendors:
	 - each vendor who wants to support the application shall expose specific API.
8.	The manager orders capsules with his own credentials, including the payment method:
	 - LaTazza shall use the API exposed by the banks.

# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
|Manager           | Super user of the system, sells capsules, manages the inventory, manages the credits and the debts of employees | 
|Owner         	  |  Provides online system and supplies it to the manager           | 
|Employee         | Drinks coffee / tea and can use his local account | 
|Visitor             |  Drinks coffee / tea |

|Inventory Admin |Manages LaTazza warehouse|
|Capsules Vendor  | Sell capsules |

# Context Diagram and Interfaces
## Context Diagram

The context diagram can be derived.

- The principal actors in the system are the following:

	- **Manager**
	- **Employee**

The system itself has references to the inventory for the capsules, so the latter is not needed in the representation.	

```plantuml
left to right direction
skinparam packageStyle rectangle
actor "Employee" as e
actor "Manager" as m
actor "Capsules Vendor" as cv
actor "Credit Card System" as ccs

rectangle System {
  (LaTazza) as lt
  e--lt
  m--lt
  lt--cv
  lt--ccs
}
```

## Interfaces
The following interfaces are needed for the realization of the system.

| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Manager     | GUI | Computer |
| Employee     | GUI | Computer |
| Capsules Vendor | APIs for orders  | Internet Connection |
| Credit Card System     | APIs to allow payments | Internet Connection |

Each actor among Manager and Employee will exploit a different type of account, more in particular:

	1. General/Admin for Managers
	2. Local for Employees
Of course, each account will manage the users in different ways with different permissions.
For what concerns a visitor, he must refer to the Manager anytime he wants to perform a purchase.

# Stories and Personas


Rachel Green (Manager)

46, secretary at "Senses & Feelings Corporation", mother of two children

As the secretary of the company, Rachel has been picked to manage the LaTazza system, to maintain the order in the usage of the coffee maker and to do the required actions to keep the capsules supply always available. She also has the job to sell capsules to those visitors who want make use of it.

It is the end of the week and Rachel notices from the inventory of the application that the supply of the Arabic cofee capsules is almost finished and she has to immediately put an order of some boxes of them to avoid any lack the following week.
Once logged in, she selects the type of capsules and the quantity to order, raising up the load compared to the previous time, due to the fast consumption. Then she buys them with her own money.
As soon as the payment has been done, she is able to keep filling the papers her boss told her to before the end of her working week.

---

Ted Mosby (Employee)

25, architect at "Building Stuff Association", single and living alone

Being a young man at his first experience in living alone, Ted is not used to have breakfast at home and his being late tendency does not let him have it too. So it is essential for him to have a coffee maker at work to charge the batteries in view of a long working day.

It is monday morning.
After a rough weekend out of town with his friends, Ted needs to gain some concentration with a coffee, but he has neither a capsule nor any cash in his account. After logging in, he recharges its balance and then he buys 15 capsules, hoping that they will be enough for the entire week. Later he drinks his daily morning coffee and chitchats with his colleague before the start of the shift.
After the energy refill he heads to his office and he is ready to start to work on the new project commissioned.

---

Meredith Grey (Visitor)

69, retired, widow

Meredith is not a patient woman, so when she has a fixed appointment for her checkups, she does not want to wait further than the expected. The only way to make her waiting better is a hot cup of tea, her favourite beverage.

It is Wednesday afternoon.
As any other time, Meredith is on time for her monthly checkup at the private clinic, but the doctors are not ready yet. Therefore she needs a cup of tea to spend the time while waiting to be visited.
Meredith asks for it to the front-desk girl and she sells her a Lemon-tea capsule. Once payed for it, she gets her tea and enjoys the delay in a relaxed way.
The time lost was not so terrible with that beverage and now she is even more ready and calm to be supervised by the medical crew.

## Use cases


### Use case 1, UC1
| Employee        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | The user must have a company ID. |  
|  Post condition     | The account is created and its information are stored in the server. |
|  Create an account     | Before enjoying LaTazza system, the employee shall create his own account using his company ID. He must fill some forms and possibly his payment credentials. |
|  Variants     | If the company ID is associated with another account, the operation fails. |

### Use case 2, UC2
| Employee |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | There must be a valid employee account. The amount of capsules to buy is available in the inventory. |
|  Post condition     | The inventory updates the availability of capsules. |
|  Buys capsules | The employee wants to buy one or more capsules (max 100) from LaTazza system. He can pay them through cash, or with credits from his account or by creating a debt (max 20 €) on his account. After the purchase, the order is added to the employee's account and the system inventory is automatically updated. |
|  Variants     | If the employee uses the credit card payment and he has not enough money, the operation fails. |

### Use case 3, UC3
| Manager |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | There must be a valid manager account. The amount of capsules to buy is available in the inventory. |
|  Post condition     | The inventory updates the availability of capsules. |
|  Buys capsules | The manager wants to buy one or more capsules from LaTazza system. Since when he orders capsules from vendors he shall pay with his own bank account, he theoretically already has them, but to make the system work properly he shall use the application without paying in order to automatically update the inventory state. |
|  Variants     | If the system notifies a low quantity of a certain type of capsules, the manager can decide to place an order of boxes. |

### Use case 4, UC4
| Manager |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | There must be a valid manager account. The amount of capsules to sell is available in the inventory. |
|  Post condition     | The inventory updates the availability of capsules. |
|  Sells capsules | The manager sells capsules by decreasing the number of capsules available in the inventory, while being paid by cash. |
|  Variants     | If the system notifies a low quantity of a certain type of capsules, the manager can decide to place an order of boxes. |

### Use case 5, UC5
| Manager |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | There must be a valid manager account. |
|  Post condition     | The inventory updates the availability of capsules in case of any actions by the manager. |
|  Inventory Management | The Manager is able to check the inventory status and to see how many capsules remain for each beverage type. If necessary, he can order from vendors more boxes of capsules. The system saves the transaction and updates the inventory. The system can also notify the Manager when a type of capsules is finishing. He also has the ability to see all previous transactions and previous sells of capsules. |
|  Variants     | If the manager has not enough money in his credit card, the boxes purchase operation fails. |

## Use case 6, UC6
| Manager, Employee        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | There must be a valid account. |  
|  Post condition     | The system logs any operation and updates the status of the account in the server. |
|  Account Management     | The User can modify his public and private information: he can add credits or pay debts doing a payment by cash or digital system. |
|  Variants     | Any payment operation could fail if there is not enough money in the credit card. |

## Use case 7, UC7
| Manager        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | There must be a valid manager account. |  
|  Post condition     | The system logs any operation and updates the status of the account in the server. |
|  User Account Management     | The manager has the privileges to manage other users account. He not only can delete an account (ex. if an employee is fired), but also leave his privileges to another user (ex. if the manager wants to quit). Finally, when an employees pays off his debt using cash, the manager can update his account by zeroing the debt. |
|  Variants     | If the manager leaves his privileges to an employee, there is a change of roles and he becomes an employee. |
